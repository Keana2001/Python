This Python script performs a basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of mall customers, typically used in customer segmentation and marketing analytics. It loads the dataset from a CSV file (Mall_Customers.csv) using the pandas library and renames the columns for consistency and readability.

The script begins by displaying the first few rows of data, prints a summary of the dataset's structure, and checks for any missing values. It then generates descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for the numerical columns.

A key visual output of the script is a scatter plot that shows the relationship between customersâ€™ Annual Income and their Spending Score, colored by Gender. This plot helps in identifying patterns or clusters of consumer behavior, which can be useful for targeted marketing strategies.

Note for Users:
This script uses the following Python libraries:
- pandas for data manipulation
- matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

This script is ideal for beginners learning data visualization and customer behavior analysis, or as a starting point for building machine learning models like clustering.
